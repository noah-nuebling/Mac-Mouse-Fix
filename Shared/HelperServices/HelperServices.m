/// Notes on availability
///     HelperServices uses a new API for registering the Helper as UserAgent under macOS 13.0 Ventura. It's called `SMAppService`. It's not available pre-Ventura. To handle this we use Apple's availability APIs.
///     Unfortunately there have been problems with the availability APIs. See https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix/issues/241.
///     Below you can find my notes / stream of consciousness on trying to figure this out.
///
///     __General confusion__: Apple uses `API_AVAILABLE()` on ObjC and Swift interfaces . But we want to mark a static C function implementation for availability. This isn't documented anywhere I could find. But it does successfully give a warning when you try to call the C function outside an `if @available` block, and it let's you use `SMAppService` inside the marked function without an `if @available` block. So it really lets you think that it's not running the code pre Ventura and that everything is fine. Yet, apparently it tries to link the unavailable code on older versions and then crashes.
///     Sidenote: Not sure where the underscore variant `__API_AVAILABLE` comes from.
///     __Summary of Problem__: Users that don't use Ventura have experienced crashes that happen while trying to link `SMAppService`. (Which isn't available pre-Ventura).
///     __Ideas for what's the problem__: 1. `__` underscores variant of the macro shouldn't be used and breaks things. 2. Availability macro doesn't work properly on C functions. 3. We STILL need to wrap code inside the `API_AVAILABLE`d function with `if @available` blocks. (Even though Xcode gives no warning against this)
///     -> It's hard to know because I can't test older versions right now.
///     Edit: Looked at `__API_AVAILABLE` and `API_AVAILABLE`, and I think they are probably identical.
///     __Game plan__: Fix all the possible reasons we could come up with: 1. Use non-underscore variant. 2. Make all the unavailable function into objc methods (and make sure they are marked in the header too, if they appear there) 3. wrap everything in `if @available` blocks. Bing bam boom.

///     Upate 14.08.2022 Still crashes for the dude. Made another change: All mentions of macOS 11, 12, 13 have been replaced with 11.0, 12.0, 13.0. Because all the examples on the internet write it like that. Let's see if that helps. Edit: That fixed it! See https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix/issues/241

         So we're removing the helper from launchd before trying to enable to hopefully fix this. Edit: seems to fix it!
         I'm pretty sure that if we didn't check for `launchdPathIsBundlePath` in `strangeHelperIsRegisteredWithLaunchd` this issue wouldn't have occured and we wouldn't need this workaround. But I'm not sure anymore why we do that so it's not smart to remove it.

    /**
     
     Helper function for + repairLaunchdPlist
     Changes permissions of the item at filePath to allow writing by the user to that item
     
     __Motivation__
     - This is intended to be used by + repairLaunchdPlist to unlock the LaunchAgents folder so we can write our LaunchdPlist into it.
     - For some reason, many users have had troubles enabling Mac Mouse Fix recently. Many of these troubles turned out to be due to the LaunchAgents folder having it's permissions set to 'read only'. This function can be used to fix that.
        - See for example Issue [#54](https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix/issues/54)
        - There was also another GH issue where the user orignially figured out that permissions were the problem which prompted me to add better logging. But I'm writing this function much later. So I can't remember which GH Issue that was. Props to that user anyways.
    
     __Notes__
     - I really hope this doesn't break anything. Changing permissions in the file system feels somewhat dangerous.
     - Also it might be a good idea to ask the user if they want the permissions to be changed, but 99.9% of users won't even understand what they are deciding about, and it would be a lot of work to present this in a good way. So I think this should be fine.
