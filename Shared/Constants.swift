/// Cache default flags dispatch flags
/// - Usage: pass this to your `dispatchQueue.async` calls to make them a little faster.
/// - For some reason, in the CPU profile I saw that when you call `dispatchQueue.async { <some stuff> }` in TouchAnimatorBase.cancel(), a significant amount of CPU is used to initialize the default `flags: DispatchWorkItemFlags` argument. So use `dispatchQueue.async(flags: defaultDFs) { <some stuff> }` instead to speed things up.
/// - At the time of writing I've adopted this in TouchAnimator and TouchAnimatorBase. Thought about extending DispatchQueue or DispatchWorkItemFlags to make usage automatic, but I don't know how and I don't really think it matters anywhere else performance-wise. (Really it only seemed to matter in the TouchAnimatorBase.cancel() since it's called so much)
