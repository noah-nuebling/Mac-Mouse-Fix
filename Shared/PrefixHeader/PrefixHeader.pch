/// I created this for CocoaLumberjack
/// Here' an explanation of prefix headers (I think that's the same as precompiled headers), as well as why they can be misused and why they've been replaced by 'modules'.
///  https://useyourloaf.com/blog/modules-and-precompiled-headers/
///  The gist is -> This makes sense for CocoaLumberjack but don't overuse it because you're too lazy to import stuff. Really think and consider before using this.

/// Include any system framework and library headers here that should be included in all compilation units.
/// You will also need to set the Prefix Header build setting of one or more of your targets to reference this file.
/// -> All targets reference this file

/// Setup CocoaLumberjack

/// I moved all the CocoaLumberjack setup from this file to WannabePrefixHeader.h.
//// For some reason there was a cryptic error saying "Could not build module 'CocoaLumberjack'" along with over 30 of other errors like "Unknown type name 'NSString' - NSObjcRuntime.h" as soon as I imported <CocoaLumberjack/CocoaLumberjack.h> here. I could not Google these errors at all
///  So instead I moved the CocoaLumberjack setup to WannabePrefixHeader.h, until I can get this to work

/// The rest of CocoaLumberjack setup is done in `setupBasicCocoaLumberjackLogging`
