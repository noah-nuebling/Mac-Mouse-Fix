/// Testing checklist
/// - `[x]` Increments daysOfUse using __normal scrolling__ after deleting lastUseDate
/// - `[x]` Increments daysOfUse using __modifiedScroll with kb mods__ after deleting lastUseDate
/// - `[x]` Increments daysOfUse using __modifiedScroll with button mods__ after deleting lastUseDate
/// - `[x]` Increments daysOfUse when using simple actions after deleting lastUseDate
///     - `[x]`  clicking
///     - `[x]` holding
///     - `[x]` clicking when a doubleClick action is set up
/// - `[x]` Increments daysOfUse when clicking and __dragging__ after deleting lastUseDate
/// - `[x]` Increments daysOfUse when scrolling after setting system to __new date__
/// - `[x]` Doesn't update daysOfUse more than once if you __don't change the date__
/// - `[x]` Increments daysOfUse when the __day changes__ without restarting the app
///     -> We tested this by setting the daily timer to 60 seconds. That successfully incremented the counter. Also tested by starting the helper before 00:00 and then using it after 00:00. That worked as well!
