/// This class works similar to the AnimationCurve class (Since renamed to `CubicUnitBezier`) I copied from WebKit
/// The difference is that this doesn't have fixed start and end controlPoints at (0,0) and (1,1), and the number of  control points isn't locked at 4. I don't need this extra functionality but it was way to fun to implement.
///
/// It's also likely muchhh slower than the Apple code, because in the Apple code they somehow transform the bezier curve into a polynomial which allows them to samlpe the curve value and derivative in a single line of c code.
/// We, on the other hand, use De-Casteljau's algorithm, which has nested for-loops and is probably in O(n*2) (Where n is the number of controlPoints describing the curve)
/// Edit: Actually, from my (superficial) testing using the Apple Time Profiler, this seems to be faster than AnimationCurve.m! Not sure how that's possible'
/// Edit2: Using simple time profiling with CACurrentMediatime(), the Swift implementation is 50 - 200 times slower than the Objc implementation. That's closer to what I expected.
///     I tested on the same curve, with a 0.001 epsilon on my Early 2015 MBP
///     BezierCurve.swift usually took around 0.0001s (= 100 microseconds = 0.1 ms) to get y(x), while AnimationCurve.m usually took around 0.000001s (= 1 microsecond = 0.001 ms)
///     -> 60 fps is 16.66 ms per frame so the Swift implemenation should be fast enough
/// Edit3: Did some more optimitzations by implementing formulas for the polynomial form of the Bezier Curve and precalculating the coefficients, very similar to how the Apple code does it. Now it's super fast to evaluate!
///     With the new algorithms Swift is only around 5 times slower than ObjC.
///         (Another thing that affected these results is that before I was building for Debug and for these tests I was building for release. - that made Swift a lot faster while barely affecting C IIRC - Edit: Yep, when running an unoptimized DEBUG build, Swift is still around 40 times slower than C)
///     Swift now takes around 0.01 ms to evaluate testing with a 0.08 epsilon, which is very important becuase 0.1 ms was way to slow (irony). I officially overengineered this lol.

/// For optimization, we usually only evaluate the x or the y values for our functions, even though these functions are formally defined to work on points. That's what the MFAxis parameters in some of these functions are for

/// It would be quite a bit nicer to have this be a struct instead of a class because of value semantics and less weird rules around initializing. But alas Swift structs aresn't compatible with Objc
