/// After playing around with NaturalAccelerationCurve I found it too floaty.
/// The cubic polynomial curve `f(x) = (ax + (bx)^2 + (cx)^3 + (dx)^4) / x` that the Apple Driver generates when using parametric acceleration feels better / more predictable to me.
/// You can see how we configured the parameters for that curve in PointerConfig.swift. Basically we made it pass through two keyPoints `p0` and `p1` and had it curve down so the slope (aka derivative) reached 0 at the second keypoint. So we bascally had a cap and made it smoothly curve into the cap.
/// The problem is that there is only one fixed curvature that satisfies this and it's not very high. Now we want to try higher curvatures.
///     (We could've almost made it more curved using the Driver Curve, using 4th coefficient `d`, but it's not possible, because `d^4` can't become negative, so it can't make the curve slop down, only up. See IOQuarticFunction / IOHIDScrollFilter or whatever they were called for context)
//
/// So now we want to create polynomial functions of arbitrary degrees that smoothly curve into the cap. So we can increase the curvature by increasing the degree.
///
/// Method:
/// See: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/sdvkwmqnmk
/// We want all (non-constant) derivatives to be equal 0 at the cap point `p1`. Not totally sure why but that seems to generate the desired curve shape.
/// To achieve this we simply use a polynomial regression feed it `p0` `p1` and some extra points.
///     - The first extra points is `p3 = (p1.x + ε, p1.y)` This will force the first derivative to be 0 somewhere between `p1.x` and `p1.x + ε`. If we make ε small enough it's as good as having the derivative be 0 at exactly `p.x`.
///     - The second extra point is `p4 = (p1.x + 2ε, p1.y)`. This will force the second derivative to be 0 somewhere between `p1.x` and `p1.x + 2ε`
///     - The third extra point is `p5 = (p1.x + 3ε, p1.y)` and so on.
/// For a polynomial of degree n, we need n-1 extra points to ensure that all derivatives go through 0 at (circa) `p1.x`

/// Notes on failing regression with curvature >= 4
///     Using
/// `iOS-Polynomial-Regression` the results become wrong at a degree 4. But it works for degree 1, 2 and 3 which is probably all we need.
///  I also tried the code from this SO answer https://stackoverflow.com/a/45735875/10601702, under "Example conventional code for generic degree equation:" but it also doesn't work for degree 4.
///  I also found this CPP implementation from NASA https://github.com/nasa/polyfit  - it ALSO didn't work. Actually fails worse than the other methods, doesn't even work properly with degree 3.
///  The only method I found that works is regression inside of Desmos or numpy.polyfit(). I tried using numpy from Swift. there is a lib called NumPy-iOS which does exactly what we want but it doesn't support macOS. So I gave up on making degree >= 4 work.
///  -> However we tested degree 4 by calculating the coefficients using numpy and inserting them manually and it doesn't feel that great. Still good but it gets a little floaty / hard to predict at that point.
///
/// Note: For degree 1 or 2 you could just use the Apple Driver's built in Parametric curve function. So you don't really need this class.
///
///  TODO: Clean up all the different regression functions that don't work.
