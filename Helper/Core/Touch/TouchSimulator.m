/// Credits:
/// I originally found the code for the `postNavigationSwipeWithDirection:` function in Alexei Baboulevitch's SensibleSideButtons project under the name `SBFFakeSwipe:`. SensibleSideButtons was itself heavily based on natevw's macOS touch reverse engineering work ("CalfTrail Touch") for his app Sesamouse from wayy back in the day. Nate's work was the basis for all all of this. Thanks Nate! :)

/// On licenses:
/// SensibleSideButtons is published under the GPL license, which requires derivative work to be published under the same or equivalent license. However we're not using any code from SensibleSideButtons any more, since we rewrote that code based on our deeper understanding of the "CalTrail Touch" code. So therefore it should be fine that we're publishing MMF under the "MMF License" now.

/// Notes:
/// 
/// Between TouchSimulator.m and GestureScrollSimulator, we have all interesting touch input covered. Except a Force Touch, but we have the kMFSHLookUp symbolic hotkey which works almost as well.
///     Edit: Actually using LookUp by any other method except force touch is broken in Safari and Mail since few versions.
