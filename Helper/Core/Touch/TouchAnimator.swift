/// (Copied from old non-vector TouchAnimator)
///
/// Only use TouchAnimator, not TouchAnimatorBase superclass directly. TouchAnimatorBase is untested and probably doesn't work right.
/// This is basically a wrapper around TouchAnimatorBase that subpixelates the output deltas. We thought it would be easier to first build the TouchAnimatorBase without the subpixelation and then add that complextity on after the fact. I think it clutters things up a lot though.

///     \Ideas for refactor: Merge TouchAnimator and TouchAnimatorBase. Maybe remove the subpixelators and just round in a way where you don't lose the rounding error.
///
/// This class does different things. An attempt to summarize: "Based on some input deltas, this class creates smoothly animated output deltas that are that are usable for driving simulated trackpad events"
/// It is currently used:
/// 1. To smooth out pointer movement before plugging it into the GestureScrollSimulator. This prevents too slow / fast momentum scroll due to irregular timeBetweenEvents.
/// 2. To apply animation and find appropriate gesture phases when mapping scrollwheel input to gestureScrolling, dockSwipes, magnification, etc.
///
/// TouchAnimator will behave just like TouchAnimatorBase with these differences:
/// The animationValueDelta values it passes to it's AnimatorCallback are always integers instead of Doubles
/// To achieve this, the internally generated Double deltas are rounded using a subpixelator which always rounds to the next larger integer (using biasedSubpixelator)
///     This is so we always generate a non-zero integer delta on the first frame of animation, which makes things more responsive when the deltas are single pixels (which they are when you use Apple Acceleration)
///
/// Callbacks wth phases kMFAnimationPhaseStart, and kMFAnimationPhaseContinue have non-zero deltas. Callbacks with kMFAnimationPhaseEnd have a delta of (0,0)
///     This behaviour will make this animator great for driving touch gesture simulations, where that kind of input is expected. (In gesture events, the end phase signals lifting your fingers off, so that's why it has a (0,0) delta)
///
/// Also has this cool momentumHint feature which lets us switch between gesture scrolls and momentum scrolls appropriately to allow for scroll bouncing and generally better behaviour.

    /// ^ This being a ceil subPixelator only makes sense because we're only using this through Scroll.m and that's only running this with positive value ranges. So the deltas are being rounded up, and we get a delta immediately as soon as the animations starts, which should make scrolling very small distances feel a little more responsive. If we were dealing with negative deltas, we'd want to round them down instead somehow. Or simply use a SubPixelator.round() which works the same in both directions.
