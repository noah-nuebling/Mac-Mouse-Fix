                 - Edit: Marking it @objc weirdly fixes the issue. Edit2: Nope, now it appeared again.
                 - SO about a similar problem: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14744378/arc-exc-bad-access-when-calling-a-method-from-inside-a-block-inside-a-delegate
                 - I think the reason might be that we were storing the block in `DisplayLink.m` with `_callback = callback` instead of `self.callback = callback`. That might prevent the block from being copied which blocks should normally be when stored as properties or something. See:
                 - https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=objc+copy+property&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8
                 - Actually, using `self.callback` shouldn't make a difference. See:
                 - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10453261/under-arc-are-blocks-automatically-copied-when-assigned-to-an-ivar-directly
