///
/// On getting the sending device:
/// - There is an "old Method" and a "new Method"
/// - How does old method work? - For the old method, we registered input callbacks on the HIDDevices and put those low level inputs in with co-occuring CGEvents to find which device sent a CGEvent
/// - Why switch away from old method? - Under Ventura I think the HID callback API broke for some devices. See https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix/issues/424. I remember similar bugs in the API in older macOS versions a few years back.
/// - Some time after moving to the newMethod I deleted the old method. You can still find it in ButtonInputReceiver_old.m and in the the MMF 1 and MMF 2 source. We might have moved away from it under MMF 2 as well to fix Ventura problems, not sure.
