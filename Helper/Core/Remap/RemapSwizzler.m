/// MARK: - Notes

/// Instead of using this directly, use [Remap modificationsWithModifiers:]. It's faster since it caches results.

/// This class provides methods for obtaining combined remaps based on a remaps dict and some active modifiers.
///     These *combined* remaps are also sometimes called *effective remaps* or *remaps for current modifiers*, "activeModifications", "modificationsActingOnButton", etc.
///     If this doesn't make sense, see an example of the remaps dict structure in Remap.m

/// More rigorous explanation:
///     The `remaps` dict in the Remap class is a dict that is defined by the user in the UI and which represents a map from modifiers -> (triggers -> effects).
///     Elements of the righthand side of this map, (which are themselves maps from (triggers -> effects)) are also often called a `modification`, and elements of the lefthand side are called the `modificationPrecondition`. The modifiers that the user is currently holding down are also called the `activeModifiers`.
///
///     The remaps dict could be considered a function r with `r(modifiers) = modification`
///     Now the **RemapSwizzler** provides functions that swizzle up an original remaps function r based on some modifiers. They look like r'(r, modifiers) = modification, where r is the remaps dict.
///
///     Why do we need this? Why not just use the original function that the user defined directly and query the dictionary?
///
///     The main reason is this:
///         When there's a `modificationPrecondition` P which is a subset of the `activeModifiers`A, but isn't exactly equal A, then we still want to activate the `modification` M that belongs to P.
///         However we *don't* want to do that if there is a different `modification` M' which is incompatible with M and which has a `modificationPrecondition` P' that matches the `activeModifiers` A better than P.
///         In that case we would only want to activate M' and not M.
///         I can't explain why but this makes for much better and more flexible user experience.
///         To implement this behaviour we need the RemapSwizzler instead of just querying the remaps dict directly.
///         See `subsetSwizzler()` for the implementation.
///
///     But there's a second important usecase:
///     During **addMode**, we need to change this map from modifiers -> triggers -> effects, such that any combination of trigger T and modifiers M that the user can input, is mapped to `addModeFeedback_T_M`. But this would mean c o m b i n a t o r i c e x p l o s i o n if we wanted to store that all in the remaps dict in TransformationManger. So we came up with this weird solution:
///         Basically the Remap creates a map from `noModifiers -> anyTrigger -> addModeFeedback_T`, as a dictionary, which isn't that large because there aren't that many triggers, so we can list them all. Then we dynamically swizzle up that map in **RemapSwizzler** so it becomes the full `anyModifier -> anyTrigger -> addModeFeedback_T_M` map!
///         See `addModeSwizzler()` for the implementation of that.
