/// This class provides pointer related settings. Primarily used by `PointerSpeed.m`. `PointerSpeed.m` configures Apple's HID driver to have different mouse sensitivity and acceleration curve. The implementation of the Apple driver that `PointerSpeed.m` configures can be found in `HIPointing.cpp` and in `IOHIDPointerScrollFilter.cpp`

/// **Polling rate compensation notes**
///
/// Edit: Polling rate is already accounted for in the newer macOS acceleration algorithm. See `IOHIDPointerAccelerator::accelerate`. But it's not done properly I think. (Judging from `IOKit source code (19.06.2021)`).  From my understanding, setting the `_rate` to the actual polling rate would only somewhat stabilize the acceleration when events are coming in slower or faster than the physical polling rate. But it wouldn't adjust the acceleration curve to be independent of polling rate.  Might still be have some benefits. Set via `kHIDPointerReportRateKey`
///
/// Apples driver doesn't take into account polling rate. When it measures device speed for its acceleration algorithm, it actually just uses the raw delta from the device and calls it speed. (Edit: This might not be the case for `IOHIDPointerScrollFilter.cpp`. See "More thoughts".)
///     Problem is that at equivalent movement speed and CPI, a mouse with a 2x polling rate will only have 0.5x magnitude in its raw deltas. This means the acceleration curve won't kick in properly.
///     However we have come up with a mechanism to compensate for this, so that the acceleration curve behaves the same for all devices regardless of polling rate.
///
/// - Base everything around standard polling rate. Let's say 125, because that's what most of my Logitech mice have.
/// - Let's say current device has polling rate 250
/// - 1. Multiply sensitivity by 250/125 = 2
///     - Because If the polling rate is twice as high, then the report deltas will be half as big → make acc kick in properly by multiplying with 2. (Remember that the sensitivity is a multiplier on the raw device deltas before they are passed to the acceleration curve.)
/// - 2. Divide acc curve `f(x) = ax + (bx)^2` by 2.
///     → New coefficients are a' = a/2 and b' = b/sqrt(2)
///     - Because there are twice as many events at rate = 1000 compared to 500. So we need to divide the output delta by 2 to get the same overall distance
///
/// How to get polling rate:
/// - Measure time between callbacks for either CGEvents or IOHIDValues / IOHIDReports.
/// - Do some smart processing. Like throw away values that are too big / too far from the current estimated value. Or only take max values. Or only top 10 percent or something. Round to power/multiple of 2 because polling intervals are always multiples of 2 ms I think. maybe other smart stuff. Use the CGEvent's timestamp for accurate timing
///
/// More thoughts:
/// - Not sure it makes sense to expose this in the UI. Just do it automatically when not using "macOS" pointer speed.
/// - `IOHIDPointerScrollFilter.cpp` actually supports the key `kHIDPointerReportRateKey` but I'm not sure exactly how it is used or if it evens works and `HIPointing.cpp` doesn't support it at all. (Not sure if `HIPointing.cpp` is still used in any way or in which macOS version they switched to `IOHIDPointerScrollFilter.cpp`) It will be a problem if we compensate for reportRate even though it is already compensated for, but It don't think Apples compensation is working. In my system `kHIDPointerReportRateKey` is only set on the Trackpad driver not standard mouse drivers.

        /// However, we've found no way to remove keys from IORegistryEntries. (You can also set the curves on an AppleUserHIDEventDriver's IOHIDServiceClient, which has the same effect as setting it on the RegistryEntry, but there is no way to remove keys using the IOHIDServiceClient APIs either.) - so there is no easy way to go back to the systm's default acceleration curves.
        /// I have no idea where the AppleUserHIDEventDriver even gets it's curves from, when the "HIDAccelCurves" key isn't set. The source code (IOHIPointing.cpp or IOHIDPointerScrollFilter.cpp) says that there is a fallback to using lookup tables for the acceleration if no parametric curves are defined. But there is no key for the lookup table either! So I have no idea where the curves come from.
        /// IOHIDPointerScrollFilter.cpp also tries to load "user curves" using the key kIOHIDUserPointerAccelCurvesKey. But it that constant not defined anywhere public. I found a definition deep inside github but setting curves to that value doesn't do anything.
        /// However, instances of AppleUserHIDEventDriver driving **keyboards** do have the "HIDAccelCurves" key set for some godforsaken reason. You can see it in the IORegistry. Those same curves are defined in  `/System/Library/Extensions/IOHIDFamily.kext/Contents/PlugIns/IOHIDEventDriver.kext/Contents/Info.plist` I think that's where the IORegsitryEntry property is loaded from.
        /// Even though these curves are defined for keyboard drivers, they feel perfect when you set them for the "HIDAccelCurves" key on a mouse driver instance. Exactly like the default acceleration if you hadn't set "HIDAccelCurves" as far as I can tell.
