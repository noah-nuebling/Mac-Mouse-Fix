#  ScrollConfigTesting

## Figuring out lowInertia settings (1. December 2022) 

/// NOTES on figuring out the lowInertia curve:
/// - 120ms is max to make pure linear curve feel responsive
/// - 110ms is max to make exp=1.0, coeff=30 feel responsive
/// - 110ms, exp=1.0, coeff=20 still feels responsive, but slightly floaty at the end (not a bad thing)
/// - stopSpeed 10 is the lowest to make 110ms, exp=1.0, coeff=20, not have pixel creep at the end
///     -. Feels much better than 50, because 50 makes single ticks stop abruptly. Medium values like 25 also feel less smooth than 10 and not really more responsive . I think 10 is good.
///     - stopSpeed 15 removes some additional creep (not "pixel-creep" but still feels a little annoying) -> Like that better
///   -
/// - coeff=15 (with 110ms, exp=1.0, stop=10) is the lowest that doesn't feel trackpad-y, but it somehow makes single ticks feel abrupt. I don't quite understand why. 20 feels better though.
/// -> Local optimum: 110ms, exp=1.0, coeff=20, stop=15
///
/// Expoerimenting with different dragExponent:
///
/// coeff=75 is minimum for responsive feel with exp=0.9, 110ms, coeff=75, stop=15
///     SIDENOTES:
///     - lowering exp makes the single steps shorter compared to the swipes
///     - increasing exp makes single steps longer compared to swipes
///     - exp is extremely sensitive. A 0.1 change feels huge
///     - Adjusting exp hugely affects the whole curve. You have to compensate by severely adjusting coeff. Looked at the formulas on Desmos and still don't understsand why. Maybe there's an error in our maths code
///     - lowering base ms makes more responsive at first but also makes drag kick in harder so it can make things less responsive that way I think?
///     - lowering coeff should make things smoother but sometimes makes single ticks feel more abrupt
///
/// New sweetspot: 110ms, exp=1.2, coeff=17, stop=15
///     -> Increasing exp makes single ticks feel smoother and swipes more responsive. Lowering coeff a little to compensate
///     -> When we set the coeff to 10 instead of 17 it feels LESS smooth. I don't understand why. Also tried 15 and 20 and they feel worse.
/// exp=1.3 seems to be too much, no matter how we set the coeff
///
/// Trying to go slightly less responsive to make text nice and readable during swipes
/// New sweetspot: 110ms exp=0.95, coeff=25, stop=15
/// Also nice: 110ms, exp=1.05, coeff=22, stop=15 (tried lowering coeff but makes ticks feel abrubt for some reason)
///
/// Sweetspots:
/// - 1. 110ms, exp=1.0, coeff=20, stop=15
/// - 2. ??? 110ms, exp=0.9, coeff=75, stop=15
/// - 3. 110ms, exp=1.2, coeff=17, stop=15
/// - 4. 110ms, exp=1.05, coeff=22, stop=15
/// - 5. ??? 110ms, exp=1.05, coeff=22, stop=15
///
/// Face off!!!
/// 1. vs 3.
///     -> 1. Feels too floaty (Might benefit from lowering ms), 3. is very direct but nice. Maybe too direct
///     -> 3. Wins
/// 3. vs 4.
///     -> 3. is too direct, 4. still super responsive but more smooth
///     -> 4. Wins
///
/// Comparing with MMF 2
/// New sweetspot: 5. 110ms, exp=1.05, coeff=17, stop=15
/// -> Brings single ticks and overall speed in line with MMF 2. Swipes feel more responsive than MMF2 -> NICE
/// New ??? sweetspot: 120ms, exp=1.05, coeff=15, stop=15
/// -> Makes single ticks feel like MMF 0.9, but too unresponsive.
/// -> Can't find a response-feeling setting where the single ticks feel as good as MMF 1 :(
///
/// Face off!!!
/// 4. vs 5.
/// -> 5. Wins. It's more smoother and nicer.
/// -> I think the reason why we went for more smoothness in 5 is because we made the step size much higher. Since the "high" setting in MMF 3 (currently) matches the default setting in MMF 2 step-size wise.
///     SIDENOTE: Higher step size makes more smoothness feel appropriate. But more smoothness also makes higher step size more appropriate. We're already making the speed higher based on the smoothness. Could/should we also adjust the smoothness beased on the stepsize? The inertia already does this automatically to some extent. Idk.
///
/// Making ms higher. There is no other way to make the steps at high speed easy to follow with your eyes.
/// ?? sweetspot:                       140ms, exp=1.05, coeff=17, stop=15
///     -> like thie even more: 6. 140ms, exp=1.05, coeff=15, stop=15
/// Also like: 140ms, exp=1.06, coeff=17, stop=15
///
/// Face off!!!
///  5. vs 6.
///  -> 6. Wins HARD
///  -> 6 is everything I never managed to achieve with MMF 1 and MMF 2. It has the super smooth, elegant-feeling single ticks of MMF 0.9, but it also has the responsivity of MMF 1 / 2. Very happy with it.
///
/// EDIT: 6, Is great. I also changed the stop speed to 30 on 6. Otherwise there was a little creep at the end that felt bad. Also made that change to the high Inertia settngs so they are in sync I gues. Not sure if that's necessary

EDIT2: Also here are some old curves that were still around commented out when I started these tests:

- 100ms exp=1.0 coeff=30 stop=50
- 140ms exp=1.0 coeff=30/*23*/ stop=50
- 120ms exp=1.0 coeff=23 stop=50

EDIT 3: 

I wrote about how 6. feels like MMF 0.9 but I think I was testing against 0.9.2 Beta which already has the more snappy scrolling. The real 0.9.1 and 0.9 scrolling feels a lot smoother than 6. but also less responsive. 6. does feel noticably smoother than 2.2.3 though. I think it's a good compromise

## Og testing 

(Using BezierHybridCurve for everything)

__Final Settings__
(The settings which will appear in the app)

1. Low Inertia
-> Use "4.2 MMF 3"

2. Mid Inertia
→ Use "3. Snappy"

3. High Inertia
→ Use "2.3 Xcode Momentum 4"
→ If you simply switch on the "sendMomentumScrolls" setting in ScrollConfig.swift, then the "2.3 Xcode Momentum 4" settings will be automatically applied

__Inertial settings__

1. __Inertial base__ 
- pxPerTickBase: 60
- pxPerTickEnd: 120
- BaseCurve: (0,0), (0,0), (1,1), (1,1) 
- msPerStep: 220
- dragCoefficient: 15
- dragExponent: 1.0
- stopSpeed: 20.0
- > This is nice. Swipes might take a little too long

1.2. Inertial fast stop
- pxPerTickBase: 60
- pxPerTickEnd: 120
- BaseCurve: (0,0), (0,0), (1,1), (1,1) 
- msPerStep: 220
- dragCoefficient: 15
- dragExponent: 1.0
- stopSpeed: 50.0 <- This changed
- > This stop speed is in line with MOS and prevents 'pixel creep'

1.3. Inertial Fast comedown
- pxPerTickBase: 60
- pxPerTickEnd: 120
- BaseCurve: (0,0), (0,0), (1,1), (1,1) 
- msPerStep: 220
- dragCoefficient: 6.5 <- These 
- dragExponent: 1.2 <-      changed
- stopSpeed: 20.0
- > Similar to 1. but with higher exp to make it slow down from high speed faster. (And lower coefficient to balance it out). Feels weird for some reason.

2. __Trackpad-style__
- pxPerTickBase: 60
- pxPerTickEnd: 160
- BaseCurve: (0,0), (0,0), (1,1), (1,1) 
- msPerStep: 200
- dragCoefficient: 30
- dragExponent: 0.8
- stopSpeed: 50
    - This is really good!! 30 and 0.8 are the exact parameters we use in GestureScrollSimulator to approximate the curve of Apples Trackpad driver. This feels great!! Since it's the same curve, we can even send these events as MomentumScroll events which will make the overscroll feels amazing! I'll almost certainly go with this for the Inertial scrolling.

2.2 Actual trackpad-style (too floaty)
- pxPerTickBase: 60
- pxPerTickEnd: 160
- BaseCurve: (0,0), (0,0), (1,1), (1,1) 
- msPerStep: 200
- dragCoefficient: 30
- dragExponent: 0.7 <- This changed
- stopSpeed: 50
    - Edit: I just found the real GestureScrollSimulator values are 30 and 0.7 (not 0.8). That's a bummer because 0.7 is too floaty imo. 

2.2 Xcode momentum 1
- pxPerTickBase: 60
- pxPerTickEnd: 160
- BaseCurve: (0,0), (0,0), (1,1), (1,1) 
- msPerStep: 200
- dragCoefficient: 27 <- These changed
- dragExponent: 0.8 <- 
- stopSpeed: 50
    - Edit: We don't actually need to emulate the real trackpad output. Our momentumScroll phase just needs to not be noticably shorter than the Xcode generated momentum scroll. Because if it is, then the Xcode momentumScroll will get cut short (And many other apps have this problem, too). That's our only constraint I think. Since the Xcode momentum scroll is shorter and snappier than the real momentum scroll, we're in luck! We don't have to use the floaty 2.2 settings.
    -> These settings feel pretty similar to the Xcode momentum scroll to me. 
    -> We'll have to test these values once we have the Hybrid curve momentum scroll algorithm, to know if they work or if they cut short / differ too much from the the Xcode animation. 
    -> (Stop speed can differ from Xcode animation I think since there we want to cut the animation short.)
    -> Actually the time till it slows down at high speeds is much shorter than Xcode at 0.8... Might not work after all

2.2 Xcode momentum 2 (more accurate to Xcode)
- pxPerTickBase: 60
- pxPerTickEnd: 160
- BaseCurve: (0,0), (0,0), (1,1), (1,1) 
- msPerStep: 200
- dragCoefficient: 40 <- 
- dragExponent: 0.7 <- These changed
- stopSpeed: 50

2.3 Xcode momentum 3 (more snappy)
- pxPerTickBase: 60
- pxPerTickEnd: 160
- BaseCurve: (0,0), (0,0), (1,1), (1,1) 
- msPerStep: 220 <- This changed
- dragCoefficient: 40
- dragExponent: 0.7
- stopSpeed: 50
    -> Increasing the msPerStep actually makes the time taken for small flicks shorter
    
2.3 Xcode momentum 4 (ticks feel awesome)
- pxPerTickBase: 60
- pxPerTickEnd: 160
- BaseCurve: (0,0), (0,0), (1,1), (1,1) 
- msPerStep: 205 <- This changed
- dragCoefficient: 40
- dragExponent: 0.7
- stopSpeed: 50
    -> Might be placebo, but I think the 205 msPerStep makes single ticks feel nicer
    -> Smaller msPerStep make single ticks feel even less stiff, but that makes time taken for small flicks longer. Might need more testing. Edit: 180 still feels nice, probably don't wanna go lower. As high as 280 still feels decent, but it makes the single ticks very stiff
    -> Played around with stopSpeed = 20. It feels nice but too much like you're forced to 'watch' animations

3. __Snappy__
- pxPerTickBase: 60
- pxPerTickEnd: 160
- BaseCurve: (0,0), (0,0), (1,1), (1,1) 
- msPerStep: 180
- dragCoefficient: 10
- dragExponent: 1.1
- stopSpeed: 50

3.1 Snappy 2
- pxPerTickBase: 40 <- These changed
- pxPerTickEnd: 110 <-
- BaseCurve: (0,0), (0,0), (1,1), (1,1) 
- msPerStep: 140 <-
- dragCoefficient: 10
- dragExponent: 1.1
- stopSpeed: 50
    -> This is very snappy but still sort of floaty. I like "3. Snappy" and "4.2 MMF 3" better

3.2 Medium 2

pxPerTick: Same as 3. Snappy
msPerStep: 180, 
baseCurve: ScrollConfig.linearCurve, 
dragExponent: 1.0, 
dragCoefficient: 15, 
stopSpeed: 50,  
    -> Found this randomly by making the MMF setting gradually more inertial


3.3 Mouse Remap
- pxPerTickBase: 120 (with 2/3 inertia factor applied, so it's actually 80)
- pxPerTickEnd: 180 (with 2/3 inertia factor, so it's actually 120)
- BaseCurve: (0,0), (0,0), (1,1), (1,1) 
- msPerStep: 190
- dragCoefficient: 17
- dragExponent: 1.0
- stopSpeed: 50
    -> This is based on `Mouse Fix (last version before Xcode fucked up).prefPane`. The settings seem to be same as any pre-0.9.2-releases.
    -> What makes the single steps feel so good is the large step size (aka pxPerTickBase)
    -> Without the large steps, it's almost the same as `3.2 Medium 2` - but slightly better imo


4. __MMF__
- pxPerTickBase: 60
- pxPerTickEnd: 90
- BaseCurve: (0,0), (0,0), (1,1), (1,1) 
- msPerStep: 110
- dragCoefficient: 20
- dragExponent: 1.0
- stopSpeed: 50 
    -> This emulates the feel of the old MMF scrolling algorithm very closely
    
4.1 MMF 2
- pxPerTickBase: 60
- pxPerTickEnd: 90
- BaseCurve: (0,0), (0,0), (1,1), (1,1) 
- msPerStep: 140 <- These changed
- dragCoefficient: 25 <-
- dragExponent: 1.0
- stopSpeed: 50 
    -> This is very stiff, but medium speed scrolls are smoother
    
4.2 MMF 3
- pxPerTickBase: 60
- pxPerTickEnd: 90
- BaseCurve: (0,0), (0,0), (1,1), (1,1) 
- msPerStep: 140
- dragCoefficient: 23 <- This changed
- dragExponent: 1.0
- stopSpeed: 50 
    -> Little bit less stiff
    
4.3 No inertia inspired
- BaseCurve: (0,0), (0,0), (1,1), (1,1) 
- msPerStep: 160 <- This changed
- dragCoefficient: 20 <- This changed
- dragExponent: 1.0
- stopSpeed: 50
    -> Feels similar to 5. No inertia
    -> You may want to make the msPerStep even larger?

5. __No inertia__

- BaseCurve: (0,0), (0,0), (0.5,1), (1,1) 
- msPerStep: 250
- dragCoefficient: 999999
- dragExponent: 99999
- stopSpeed: 99999
    -> Actually liking this better than the MMF ones right now

__Acceleration Settings__

pxPerTickBase: 
    10 (Low), 40 (Mid), 60 (High)

pxPerTickEnd:

Max good-feeling pxPerTickEnd

- Screensize: 2160, 2.3 Xcode Momentum 4 –– 180
- Screensize: 2160, 3.1 Snappy 2 –– 130
- Screensize: 1080, 2.3 Xcode Momentum 4 –– 160
- Screensize: 1080, 3.1 Snappy 2 –– 110

Min good-feeling pxPerTickEnd

- Screensize: 1080, 2.3 Xcode Momentum 4 –– 80

MMF1-feeling pxPerTickEnd

- Screensize: 846, "4. MMF" –– 80


Formula to calculate pxPerTickEnd: (based on the tests above)

```
pxPerTickEnd = pxPerTickEndBase * inertiaFactor + screenHeightSummant
where
    pxPerTickEndBase =
        160 if pxPerTickEndSemantic = "large"   (180 is good after making acceleration curve linear)
        120 if pxPerTickEndSemantic = "medium"  (130 or 140 might be better after making acceleration curve linear)
        80 if pxPerTickEndSemantic = "small"    (90 might be better after making acceleration curve linear)
where
    inertiaFactor = 
        1 if inertia="2.3 Xcode Momentum 4"
        3/4 if inertia="3 Snappy"
        2/3 if inertia="4. MMF"
where
    screenHeightSummant = 
        (screenHeightFactor-1)*20 if screenHeightFactor > 1
        ((1/screenHeightFactor)-1)*-20 if screenHeightFactor < 1
            where screenHeightFactor = actualScreenHeight / 1080
```
→ Not sure if the screenHeightSummant makes sense. It's just constructed so that 
    ```
    screenHeightSummant(screenHeightFactor = 1) = 0
    screenHeightSummant(screenHeightFactor = 2) = 20
    screenHeightSummant(screenHeightFactor = 1/x) = - screenHeightSummant(screenHeightFactor = x) –– (where x < 1)
    ``` 

Testing the formula: (calculating pxPerTickEnd values based on the formula)

- Screensize 2160, "3.1 Snappy 2", "small" –– 80*(2/3) + 20 = 73 –– Feels good
- Screensize 1080, "3.1 Snappy 2", "small" –– 80*(2/3) = 53 –– Feels good
- Screensize 2160, "3.1 Snappy 2", "large" –– 160*(2/3) + 20 = 126 –– Feels good
- Screensize 846, "3.1 Snappy 2", "large" –– 160*(2/3) - 5 = 102 –– Feels good
- Screensize 846, "3.1 Snappy 2", "small" –– 80*(2/3) - 5 = 48 –– Feels good
- Screensize 846, "4. MMF", "medium" –– 120*(2/3) - 5 = 75 –– Feels good
- Screensize 1080, "3. Snappy", "large" –– 160*(3/4) = 120 –– Feels good

-> Formula seems to work well enough

---

__Notes__

- Should msPerStep change as the user adjusts pxPerTick? - No I don't think so. It feels good with a constant msPerStep.
- Should the pxPerTick options change as the user chooses different inertial feels? - Yes. The more inertia, the more do larger pxPerTick (or at least pxPerTickEnd) make sense. 
- Should the pxPerTick options change when there is more screen real estate? - Maybe? It does feel more appropriate to use large pxPerTick (or at least pxPerTickEnd) with more screenSpace
