            /// Why do this in such a weird way?
            /// - We need to launch a new helper instance instead of just using the normal helper instance because `AXIsProcessTrustedWithOptions` will only add the helper to System Settings __once__ after launch. Subsequent calls don't do anything.`AXIsProcessTrustedWithOptions` is also the __only__ way to check if we already have accessibility access. And we need to check if we already have access __before__ deciding to reset the access, because we don't want to reset access if it has already been granted. So therefore we need to do the intial check and the forced system settings update in two different instances of the helper. You would think normally relaunching the helper would solve this but...
            /// - We can't just relaunch the helper normally through launchd because launchd permits at most 1 start per 10 seconds. So if the helper's just been enabled and there's no accessibility access you have to wait 10 seconds until the helper can be restarted through launchd.
            /// -> So we start a new instance of the helper independently of launchd and let it update the accessibility settings and then quit immediately.

            /// - This doesn't work under macOS 10.13 and 10.14 because `tccutil` doesn't take bundleID argument there (bundleID arg was introduced in 10.15 - Src: https://eclecticlight.co/2020/01/28/a-guide-to-catalinas-privacy-protection-4-tccutil/).
